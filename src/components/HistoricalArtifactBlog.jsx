          Historical artifacts are physical remains of past civilizations — tools, clothing, manuscripts, or even
          everyday objects. These artifacts help us understand how people lived, what they believed, and how their
          societies functioned.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the advancement of technology, preserving these items digitally has become more important than ever.
          Digitization protects fragile items from decay while allowing researchers and the public to access them
          online. High-resolution scans and detailed descriptions can now be stored safely in digital archives.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, digital preservation brings its own challenges — such as file format obsolescence, data loss, and
          long-term maintenance. Institutions must invest in secure digital systems to ensure future generations can
          benefit from these virtual collections.
        </p>

        <p>
          The integration of technologies like 3D scanning, virtual reality, and AI is also transforming how we
          experience historical artifacts. Through VR tours, one can explore museums or archaeological sites from
          anywhere in the world, making history more accessible and engaging.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, while nothing can truly replace the authenticity of holding a centuries-old artifact, digital
          preservation ensures that the knowledge and legacy within these objects live on.
